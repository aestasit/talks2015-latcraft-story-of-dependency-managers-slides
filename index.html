# What are the standard problems?

- No dependency manager tooling
- No defined package format
- No transitive dependencies support
- No sticky versions
- No build tool integration
- No central artifact repository
- Broken system state
- Version conflicts
- Flakey versions

# Dependency managers are 2nd class citizens

???

It's easy to install dependless package. Dependencies make things complicated. Very complicated. Extremely complicated.

---

# History repeats

- Not every OS has/starts with an official package manager
- Package/dependency managers are not created by language designers
- Vendors do not really care about automation/dependencies
- Often shared library hosting is done by 3rd party

???

Some programming langauges that exist for last 2 decades got proper package manager only in this decade.
Why do we need to wait for a dependency management tool? 
Ecosystem without dependency manager leave negative history trail for that ecosystem. 
Knowing the majority of the ecosystem quirks is called EXPERIENCE!
Working with dependencies for experienced developer usually happens smoothly, becuase he knows what to avoid. 
But for every new comer it is usually a nightmare and a first thing to complain about.

# OpenSUSE SAT 

> Since the solver treats every package alike, these rules have some major and sometimes unexpected implications. 
> A broken dependency might result in removal of lots of packages - the resulting system is still consistent but probably highly unusable.

# Heterogenous environments

???

We live in a connected world. WE DEPEND ON EACH OTHER RESULTS! Everybody wants to work in isolation with minimal dependencies, but ends up with integrating a lot of external libraries
You may don't like PHP or Java or Ruby or Python or Perl or nodejs, but chances are that you'll have to install each one of them on a single server at some point.

# Situation will not change any soon!

---

# Any TRICKS?

- **Test** (with freshly fetched dependencies)
- **Release** (consistent versions)
- **Isolate** (project and system package trees)
- **Cache** (localy and in artifact repositories)
- **Keep** (dependency lists in version control)
- **Stick** (to known versions)

# Takeaways

### Vendors should be more responsible 
### Incomplete dependency managers cause a lot of extra work
### Community needs YOU!
