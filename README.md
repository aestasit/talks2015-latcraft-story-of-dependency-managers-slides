Slide deck of presentation "**Story of dependency managers**" given at **Latcraft | Ops** (Riga), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> Packages are everywhere in software development. Every ecosystem, every operating system, every programming language brings in a 'new way of managing dependent libraries and packages. What are they? Are they that much different? Why can't we have a universal package manager? Should you create yet another package manager? This presentation is based on the experience of strugling through managing dependencies in different ecosystems and gives some interesting findings.
